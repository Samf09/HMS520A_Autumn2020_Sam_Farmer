# HMS520A_Autumn2020_Sam_Farmer

This page will serve as my repo for the HMS-520 course. 
Coursework is pushed to the homework folder and will be sorted by assignment name

My name is Sam. I am a data analyst for the goalkeepers team and work with forecasting
as well. I enjoy video games, 3d printing and modeling, running, and taking my dog to
the park. I hope to someday get my masters in computer science or statistics with a career
goal of becoming a software engineer or data scientist.
